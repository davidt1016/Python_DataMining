## Description of the Data Mining Source Codes:

There are four main data mining techniques used in the source codes namely, data preprocessings, clusterings, classifications, and regressions. Each data mining technique is used for different purposes and the source codes demonstrate how some of the libraries such as sklearn are used.

### Note: The source code, ExtractTweets.py, in Word Cloud file directory requires registration for Twitter API to run the code properly (there will be an error if one tries to run the code because this source code requires Twitter API). Currently, due to privacy concern with personal account, lines 14-17 has been commented out. Once one has completed register for Twitter API through this link:https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access , one can simply uncomment those lines and put their own personal Twitter API keys.
